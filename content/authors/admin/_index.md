Working as a data scientist in a management consulting firm, my job involves helping businesses and policymakers to understand and manage consumer decision-making, solving business problems, generating data-driven insights, and developing data products.

I am also an AI / deep learning enthusiast and enjoy taking part in data science competitions and open source projects.
